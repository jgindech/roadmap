# Zuniswap public roadmap

In this repository, you can find the [official Zuniswap public protocol roadmap](about:blank). Our protocol roadmap is where you can learn about what the the community is working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the discussion over on the [Zuniswap Community Forum](about:blank) or share your feedback via the [Share feedback](about:blank) page. 

The roadmap repository is for communicating Zuniswap's roadmap. Existing issues are currently in development as we get started. Weâ€™re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of Zuniswap offerings protocols and features. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through this [Share feedback](about:blank) page.

Purpose
We aim to answer th question: What would happen if the Community Leads the way?

Strategic Fit
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been orimarily a money and crypto game for high USD value "Whales." The Zuniswap community aims to be a Gateway protocol for more people interested in DeFi and yield farming.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases. 

- A **Zuni-prop** indicates the area of the protocol to which the item belongs. For a list of current protocol areas, see below.

## Release phases

Every protocol or feature goes through a set of phases, from early testing to general availability.

- **Community Triage:** *Primarily for discussion and feedback*\
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Ideas still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for active protocol use, and no documentation.

- **in design:**\
Community is in discovery phase. The Community have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **Building:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*\
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

_More phases will be added soon._

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every protocol or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the timeline in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  You'll also find an **Exploratory** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and **exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.

Zuniswap has major releases on a monthly basis, and minor releases on a weekly basis. Once we know what version we are delivering a feature, we will update the issue to indicate that information.

## Protocol Areas

The following is a list of our current protocol areas:

- **code:** Code experiences (Repositories, Pull Requests, Gists)
