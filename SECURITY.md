# Zuniswap Security Policy

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides rewards of $30,000 or more for critical vulnerabilities.

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, [submit it here](about:blank).

You can find useful information in our [rules](about:blank), [scope](about:blank), [targets](about:blank) and [FAQ](about:blank).
